# Response to Relax Inc.'s Challenge

To determine which factors predict future user adoption, several easily interpretable machine learning algorithms were trained, and their feature importance were graphed. The models trained were Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Forest, and Support Vector Classifier. Of these two graphs of the feature importnace are posted below:

Observing the feature importance from the RandomForestClassifier, the biggest factors are the last time the user logged in, the time between the first login and the creation of the account, and the time the account was created. There was also a small influence from the size of the organization they were invited to. Looking at the LogisiticRegression, we can see if these factors predict adopted or against it. The last login time and time between creation and first login are positively correlated, meanwhile creation time and organization size. This implies that recent users are likely to be adopted users, which should be reasonable if the number of users is increasing. The time between creation and first login having positive correlation implies that users are more like to be adopted if they use the product soon after signing up. It would be reasonable to set up email reminders with higher frequency when a user first creates their account to get them into the habit of using the relax software. Since creation time has a negative correlation, it appears that older users are less likely to be retained. It also appears that users are slightly less likely to be adopted if they're invited from a larger organization. 

Although using time features in the prediction models, time based analysis is not too valueable for future predicition, rather it shows the health of growth in number of users. When the models were trained without the time features, there was virtually no predictive power. It would a appear more relevant data should be collected to determine how to improve future user adoption. Data such as what product features the users used, how long their sessions were, perhaps even what type of industry the users are in. As of now, the data can predict users only on a correlation of timely trends, which as already stated, doesn't help in improved the product or improving how marketing targets potential adopted users.
